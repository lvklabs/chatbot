*    # Rules: change from a sound (one or more letters) or a category
*    # to another sound or category, in a certain environment.
*    # Categories may only be one letter long and are usually uppercase.
*    # Environments must contain a _ symbol to show where the replacement
*    # takes place; it may also contain letters, categories, and the special
*    # symbols ( ) (to enclose optional parts) and # (beginning or end of
*    # word).
*    # Rules can only change sounds to sounds, and categories to categories.
*    # If a category is to be changed to another category, they should be
*    # the same length. Otherwise the second category will have its laster
*    # letter repeated until it has the same length as the first (if it is
*    # shorter), or characters in the second category that don't match
*    # characters in the first will not be produced by such a range. Note
*    # that this is an artefact of the use of tr/// and is not guaranteed
*    # behaviour.
*    # Don't use regex metacharacters (except for the parentheses which
*    # show optional elements) in the environment or in names of categories
*    # or sounds.
*    # These include: . * + ? ^ $ [ ]
